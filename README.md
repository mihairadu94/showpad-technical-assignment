# Pokedex

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.8.

A few libraries we use:

- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/angular/overview)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite)

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Exercise

There are some TODO comments scattered around the repo. You don't have to fix all of these TODO comments.
You can solve any issues however you want (creativity is more important than fixing things).

Here are some pieces of functionality we'd like you to add:

1. In the Pokemon list, replace the hardcoded data with a real API call.
2. In the Pokemon list, add a "load more" button that loads the next page of Pokemon.
3. In the Pokemon details, replace the hardcoded `pokemonId` with a dynamic value that changes when you click a Pokemon in the list
4. In the Pokemon details, add a new piece of functionality in the "tabs". This can be anything, be creative and do something you think is fun.
